Usage
=====

This tool can be used to download a large number of `RFC documents <https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/>`_ in a short period of time.
Since I like to keep all RFCs locally on my machine, this is the perfect way to retrieve all the documents and add new ones at a later point in time.

For a quick introduction, let me show how you would use the tool to get started.
::

    $ rfcdl -d ~/download/rfc/

As can be seen above, you have to specify a directory where all RFC documents will be saved in.
Upon the next invocation of ``rfcdl``, only the RFCs missing in that directory will be downloaded.

If you only want to download a random subset of all RFCs, use the ``--samples`` flag.
This can be used for testing.
For instance, the following will download 20 random RFC documents.
::

    $ rfcdl -d ~/download/rfc/ --samples 20

Since ``rfcdl`` downloads multiple files in parallel by default, one can specify how many simultaneous downloads are allowed using the ``--limit`` flag.
The following invocation will only download at most ten files in parallel.
::

    $ rfcdl -d ~/download/rfc/ --limit 10

To explicitly state how many times ``rfcdl`` should download a file upon error, the ``--retries`` flag can be used.
This can be useful in case one expects a bad connection.
This is how you could tell the tool to try to download each file at maximum five times.
::

    $ rfcdl -d ~/download/rfc/ --retries 5

Configuration
=============

A configuration file can be saved to ``~/.config/rfcdl/config.ini`` to avoid specifying the path for each invocation.
Of course, ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` can be set to change your configuration path.
Alternatively, the path to the configuration file can be set via the ``--config-file`` argument.

    RootDir = ~/download/rfc/
